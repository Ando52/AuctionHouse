# Auction House

## Description
The users can add items for sales to the store page. Where other users can make bids on the said items,
as well as comment on the item page. The item page can contain information such as a photo, description,
initial price, as well as a category that it belongs to.


## Challenges
- First time learning and having to map out relational database. This was needed in order to make sense of the different relationship between the tables.

## Improvements
- Would be adding a chat system so that users could talk to each other instead of through comments.
- Category selection GUI update. So that we can have a drop menu when selecting a category instead of a line of buttons
